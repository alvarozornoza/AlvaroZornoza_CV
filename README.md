# AlvaroZornoza_CV

This repository contains my curriculum vitae. Original idea from [@poquit0](https://github.com/posquit0) and his project [Awesome-CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV)

Continuous integration implemented to have the last version of my cv always available. Using [travis-latexbuild](https://github.com/Strauman/travis-latexbuild) and [Travis](https://travis-ci.com)
